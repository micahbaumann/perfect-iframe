# Perfect Iframe

## Why do you need it?
Making `<iframe>`s responsive is one of the hardest parts of makeing a responsive website. This is commonly done by using a CSS hack. The only problem is that you can't use the same class for every `<iframe>`. You have to have different classes for each aspect ratio. Perfect Iframe solves this problem. All you have to to is put the `width` and `height` attributes with the appropriate values and Perfect Iframe will do the rest!

## Features
 * One size fits all solution for making iframes responsive.
 * Add custom styles simply by putting `data-style="(your custom CSS)"` in the iframe's attributes.
