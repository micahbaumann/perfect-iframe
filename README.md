## Why do you need it?
Making iframes responsive is one of the hardest parts of makeing a responsive website. This is commonly done by using a css hack. The only problem is that you can't use the same class for every iframe. You have to have different classes for each aspect ratio. Perfect Iframe solves this problem. All you have to to is put the width and height attributes with the appropriate values and Perfect Iframe will do the rest!
